/**
 * All KernelMessage leaving the kernel for the client will exit the relay in a similar pattern. This class is meant
 * to encapsulate this behaviour into one generic method. This class should be used by mapping a
 * `org.apache.toree.kernel.protocol.v5.MessageType` to the `org.apache.toree.kernel.protocol.v5.SocketType` constructor
 * parameter. This will map MessageTypes to their corresponding SocketTypes. An example us of this class would be
 *
 * actorSystem.actorOf(
 *      //  Tells the handler to forward anything it receives to the Control socket
 *      Props(classOf[GenericSocketMessageHandler], actorLoader, SocketType.Control),
 *
 *      // Creates the Actor with the name of the message type, this allows the Relay to route messages here
 *      name = MessageType.KernelInfoReply.toString
 *   )
 *
 * @param actorLoader The ActorLoader used to load the socket actors
 * @param socketType The type of socket, mapping to an Actor for this class to pass messages along to
